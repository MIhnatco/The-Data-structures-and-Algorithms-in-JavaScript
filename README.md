# The Data structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

Welcome to my repository! This project is aimed at documenting my journey and learning progress as I study 
**Data structures and Algorithms in JavaScript**. The repository will include explanations, code 
implementations, test cases, and notes on key concepts.

## Overview
This repository serves as my learning journal and resource bank for Data structures and Algorithms using JavaScript
The repository is designed to:
  * Explore the theory behind various data structures and algorithms.
  * Provide clean, well-documented implementations in JavaScript.
  * Include time and space complexity analyses for each algorithm.

Feel free to explore the code, raise issues, or contribute if you find an improvement.

## Data structures covered
  * Arrays
  * Hash Tables 
  * Trees
  
## Algorithms covered

Each folder contains:
* Data structures/: Contains code implementation of various data structures
* Algorithms/: Contains sorting, searching, and other algorithm implementations
* Tests/: Unit test files for the implementations using libraries like Jest

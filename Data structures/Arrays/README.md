This section focuses on the **Array** data structure in JavaScript. Arrays are one of the most commonly used data structures, offering a simple way to store and access multiple values in a single variable.

## Overview

An **array** in JS is a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations. They are objects with integer based keys that act like indexes.
In JS, arrays are flexible, dynamic and can hold elements of mixed data types.

### Key Characteristics of Arrays:

- **Indexing:** Elements are accessd using zero-based indexing.
- **Dynamica Size:** JS arrays are dynamica, meaning they can grow and shring in size as needed.
- **Mixed Data types:** Arrays can contain elements of any type (numbers, strings, objects, etc.).
- **Efficient Access:** Accessing an element by its index is an O(1) operation.

## Common Operations

Here are some of the common operations that can be performed on arrays:

- **Insertion:** Add an element to the end, beginning, or a specific position.
- **Deletion:** Remove an element from the array by index or value.
- **Search:** Find the index of an element in the array.
- **Traversal:** Loop through each element to process or print values.
- **Sorting:** Rearrange elements in a specific order (ascending or descending).
- **Resizing:** JS handles resizing internally when elements are added/removed.
